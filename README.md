🗺️ Map2D Project
Visualize, Edit, and Explore 2D Grids with Colors, Obstacles, and Paths

📌 Overview
This project provides a simple framework for working with 2D grid maps in Java. It combines graphical visualization, pathfinding, and map editing tools to create interactive demos and educational projects.

✨ Features


Grid Visualization
Render maps using a graphical interface with customizable colors and scaling.


Color-Coded Cells
Represent empty spaces, obstacles, and special zones using color codes or RGB values.


Obstacles & Shapes
Add walls, circles, and other shapes to create complex environments.


Pathfinding
Compute and display shortest paths between two points on the grid.


Distance Mapping
Generate a heatmap of distances from a starting point to all reachable cells.


Flood Fill
Fill connected regions with a new color, similar to paint bucket tools.


File I/O
Save maps to text files and load them back for visualization or processing.



🖌️ Drawing Maps

Each cell is drawn as a square on a canvas.
Supports color gradients, palette-based colors, or custom RGB values.
Optional grid lines for clarity.
Handles cyclic wrapping for toroidal maps.


🎨 Colors
Two approaches for color representation:

Palette Codes: Simple integers mapped to predefined colors.
RGB/ARGB Values: Full flexibility for custom colors and transparency.


🧭 Pathfinding

Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) for shortest paths in grids.
Supports cyclic wrapping for edge-to-edge connectivity.
Optional diagonal movement (configurable).
Visualize paths as dots or continuous lines.


🔍 Distance Maps

Compute distances from a starting point to all reachable cells.
Visualize as a gradient heatmap for intuitive understanding.


🪣 Flood Fill

Fill connected regions with a new color.
Works with cyclic wrapping for edge-connected areas.

📂 Save & Load

Maps stored in a simple text format
Easy to share and reload for experiments.

🧩 Shapes

Draw circles, lines, and patterns directly on the grid.
Combine shapes to create obstacles or decorative elements.


✅ Use Cases

Pathfinding demonstrations
Game map editors
Algorithm visualization (BFS, flood fill)
Educational projects for data structures and AI


🚀 Getting Started

Create a map with desired dimensions.
Add obstacles or shapes using color codes.
Visualize the map with the GUI.
Compute paths or distance maps and overlay them.
Save your work and reload anytime.


💡 Tips

Flip Y-axis if your grid origin is top-left (StdDraw uses bottom-left).
Enable double-buffering for smooth rendering.
Use cyclic mode for wrap-around maps.
